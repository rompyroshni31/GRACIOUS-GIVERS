### Gracious Givers is all about helping people around Us. This is done by Charity and Donation. 
Here is how it goes - Most people underestimate their ability to make a positive change in the world. Theyâ€™re overwhelmed by the sheer number of things that need to be done, all the people that need help, and all the worthy causes that exist. However, lots of individuals making small efforts can change the world. Here is an opportunity for everyone to give and receive the blessings.
Firstly, We are working on an initiative of "Street Food Box". In this You can drop your left out food at our installed boxes at respective stations. This collected food will be pass on to poor and homeless people.
Secondly, We are working on Donating school supplies which will help poor students in their education without worring about their financial conditions. This will surely motivate them to learn new skills and enhance their knowlegde.
and finally we have a separate page for You to share your experiences and stories with us where you helped someone in need.
